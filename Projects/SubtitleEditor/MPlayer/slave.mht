OCOL
-------------------

The -slave option switches on slave mode, in which MPlayer works as a backe=
nd
for other programs. Instead of intercepting keyboard events, MPlayer will r=
ead
commands separated by a newline (\n) from stdin.

To try slave mode out by hand, run

  mplayer -slave -quiet &lt;movie&gt;

and type slave commands into the console window.

You can also use a FIFO file (named pipe):

  mkfifo &lt;/tmp/fifofile&gt;
  mplayer -slave -input file=3D&lt;/tmp/fifofile&gt; &lt;movie&gt;

Most slave mode commands are equivalent to command line options, though not
necessarily under the same name. Detailed descriptions can be found in the
man page.

All commands can be prefixed with one of &quot;pausing &quot;, &quot;pausin=
g_keep &quot;, or
&quot;pausing_toggle &quot;. &quot;pausing &quot; tells MPlayer to pause as=
 soon as possible
after processing the command. &quot;pausing_keep &quot; tells MPlayer to do=
 so only if
it was already in paused mode. &quot;pausing_toggle &quot; tells MPlayer to=
 do so
only if it was not already in paused mode. Please note that &quot;as soon as
possible&quot; can be before the command is fully executed.
As a temporary hack, there is also the _experimental_ &quot;pausing_keep_fo=
rce &quot;
prefix, with which MPlayer will not exit the pause loop at all.
Like this you can avoid the &quot;frame stepping&quot; effect of &quot;paus=
ing_keep &quot;
but most commands will either not work at all or behave in unexpected ways.
For &quot;set_mouse_pos&quot; and &quot;key_down_event&quot;, &quot;pausing=
_keep_force&quot; is the default
since other values do not make much sense for them.


Various tips and tricks (please help expand it!):

- Try using something like
    pausing_keep_force pt_step 1
    get_property pause
  to switch to the next file. It avoids audio playback starting to play
  the old file for a short time before switching to the new one.
- To ensure the user can&#x27;t control MPlayer &quot;behind your back&quot=
; use
  something like -input nodefault-bindings -noconfig all

    Supported subtitle sources are -sub options on the command
    line, VOBsubs, DVD subtitles, and Ogg and Matroska text streams.
    This command is mainly for cycling all subtitles, if you want to set
    a specific subtitle, use sub_file, sub_vob, or sub_demux.

sub_source [source]

    SUB_SOURCE_SUBS   (0) for file subs
    SUB_SOURCE_VOBSUB (1) for VOBsub files
    SUB_SOURCE_DEMUX  (2) for subtitle embedded in the media file or DVD su=
bs.
    If [source] is -1, will turn off subtitle display.
    If [value] is omitted or less than -1, will cycle between the first sub=
title
    of each currently available source (forward or backward respectively).

sub_file [value]
    Display subtitle specified by [value] for file subs. The [value] is
    corresponding to ID_FILE_SUB_ID values reported by &#x27;-identify&#x27=

    Switch to the DVD angle with the ID [value]. Cycle through the
    available angles if [value] is omitted or negative.

switch_ratio [value]
    Change aspect ratio at runtime. [value] is the new aspect ratio express=
ed
    as a float (e.g. 1.77778 for 16/9), or special value -1 to reset to
    original aspect ratio (ditto if [value] is missing), or special value 0
    to disable automatic movie aspect ratio compensation.
    There might be problems with some video filters.

    Switch to the DVD title with the ID [value]. Cycle through the
    available titles if [value] is omitted or negative.

The following commands are really only useful for OSD menu console mode:

help
    Displays help text, currently empty.

exit
    Exits from OSD menu console. Unlike &#x27;quit&#x27;, does not quit MPl=
ayer.

hide
    Hides the OSD menu console. Clicking a menu command unhides it. Other
    keybindings act as usual.

run &lt;string&gt;
    Run &lt;string&gt; with properties expanded as shell command. In OSD me=
nu
    console mode stdout and stdin are through the video output driver.
    Property expansion happens in the same way as for osd_show_property_tex=
t.
    Note: MPlayer will do property expansion on anything of the form
    ${somevar} before it is passed to the shell.
    This means that you cannot use this syntax for anything you actually
    want the shell to handle, though any other form like $somevar will
    be passed on to and processed by the shell.

    Example:
    run &quot;echo ${filename} ${stream_pos} &gt;&gt; &lt;path_to_file&gt;&=
quot;
